Authors of technical papers often use slides to effectively present their ideas in
conferences and meetings. If there is an easy way of generating slides from a
research paper, then it would be of great use to them. In this paper, we propose the
framework of an automated system which takes the HTML version of a technical paper and generates a starting point presentation with organized headings, images, summarized
text and references that can be further turned into a final presentation. HTML version
of any paper which is in accordance with conference/journal proceedings can be given
as input to out system. The HTML file is parsed, information in it is extracted and is
converted into a predefined XML format. Then the data in this XML file is summarized
using multiple heuristics to generate most informative content. The summarized content
is then converted into a neat \LaTeX\ presentation.
