In this paper, we proposed the framework of an automated system which generates
a neat \LaTeX\ presentation from a technical paper given in HTML format. The generated
slides might not be exactly what the presenter wanted but they serve as a good starting
point to convert it into a final presentation. The system we proposed generates the slides
in 3 stages. At any stage, the users can optionally modify the content in the intermediate output like adding more keywords after the parsing stage, adding/removing sentences after
the summarizing stage which will help the system to generate better presentations.
