We used papers from SIGCHI'96 conference proceedings as our dataset. This dataset is given to us by Prof. Manish Gupta. In this dataset, there are 53 papers in HTML format. Out of these 53 papers, we used 40 papers for testing our system. The remaining 13 papers are not usable as some of them have corrupted HTML, some of them do not have the heading hierarchy, they were just flat text dumps without sections and some of them have irreparable errors in their HTML tag structure.
