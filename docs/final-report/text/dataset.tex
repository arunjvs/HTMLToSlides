We used papers from SIGCHI'96 conference proceedings as our dataset. In this dataset, there are 53 papers in HTML format. Out of these 53 papers, we used 40 papers for testing our system. The remaining 13 papers are not usable as some of them have corrupted HTML, some of them do not have the heading hierarchy, they were just flat text dumps without sections and some of them have irreparable errors in their HTML tag structure.
Each HTML page is a full size research paper having sections Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Methods, Experiments/Evaluation, Future Work, Conclusions, Acknowledgements, References with some exceptions. On an average, each paper in the dataset has 250 sentences. The intermediate output returned by the parsing step, on an average, has 80 sentences.
