Our approach consists of 3 stages, parsing, summarization
and slides generation. Parsing converts the HTML into a clean,
well-defined XML format that is used for further processing.
Summarization prunes the XML using a series of heuristics, 
to select the sections/lines that would be most relevant for
the presentation. Finally, generator stage converts the
pruned XML into \LaTeX Beamer presentation. Each of the 
stages have an intermediate output, that can optionally be
tweaked manually by user to achieve better results later, such
as tweaking the set of keywords extracted after parsing stage
can help summarization work better. We discuss each stage in detail next.
