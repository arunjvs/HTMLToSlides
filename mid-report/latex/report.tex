% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.


\section{Introduction}

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
I wish you the best of success. \cite{test}
